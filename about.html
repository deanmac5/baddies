                        <h3>Maddies Commitment to Players and Parents</h3>
                        <p>The aim of Maddies Netball Club is to progressively develop the skills and attitudes of its players
                            with the provision of the best possible organisation, facilities and coaching to enable strong,
                            healthy and enjoyable participation in the game of netball. Maddies is also a social netball
                            club however for the more serious netballer Maddies supports the players needs and will ensure
                            that the game is taken seriously at all levels of participation and management. Maddies commits
                            all of its resources to the development of players and enjoyment of the game.</p>

                        <h2>Maddies Netball Club Expectations of Players</h2>
                        <h3>Training</h3>
                        <p>Attendance at training sessions is compulsory. Training is a major focus of the club. It is the most
                            important time of the week where the club and each team gets together to practice, develop new
                            skills, improve techniques and discuss different aspects of the game of netball. Training sessions
                            are developed by the individual coaches to encompass a wide range of outcomes for their teams.
                            It is an expectation of the Maddies Netball Club that all players attend all training sessions.
                            If a player is unable to attend training due to illness or work/family commitments, the team
                            coach must be notified at the earliest possible convenience by phone, email, facebook or text
                            message. This assists in the coaches planning. Training times will be advised on notification
                            of successful membership selection. Failure to attend training may result in reduced court time
                            during competition matches. Players are expected to turn up to training in suitable warm training
                            attire (i.e. club training tops, track pants, layers of tops, netball runners). Players are to
                            wear only official uniform items during competition games. Please do not wear jewelry or adornments
                            to training as you will be asked to remove them.</p>
                        <h3>Player Nominations</h3>
                        <p>Players are to apply online using the appropriate Maddies form. Maddies policy is that all fees are
                            to be paid at time of registration or players cannot take the court. If you are unable to make
                            this commitment, please talk to our Treasurer as a payment plan may be available.</p>
                        <h3>Sponsorship</h3>
                        <p>Maddies is a not for profit organisation and seeks sponsorship each season from interested parties.
                            If you wish to provide sponsorship or are able to secure sponsorship, Maddies has an established
