                <p>Where available, badged umpires will be allocated for Div 1 games in the Senior and Intermediate grades.
                    This depends on the availability of qualified umpires and the number of teams in Division 1 Inters and
                    Seniors.

                <p>TNA provides Umpire Information sessions throughout the season. The TNA Umpires Coordinator allocates umpires
                    from a pool of Junior Rep players from Under 12&apos;s to U 15&apos;s each Saturday to umpire Grades

                <p>Becoming an umpire is now very easy; a Level One umpires course is available on line as a cost of $25 which
                    Maddies will reimburse if you complete the course and present the club with your certificate. This course
                    can be found on the <a href="https://act.netball.com.au">Netball ACT website</a>.</p>
                <p>At Maddies we mentor our umpires regardless of age and our umpires are strongly encouraged to sit the on-line
                    theory exam, which can be accessed from the Netball Australia Website. This exam along with an assessed,
                    low pressure practical umpiring session or game will get you to a National C Badge qualification.</p>

                    encourage parents as well as players to get involved in our umpiring program.</p>
