                <h2>2018 Registration Instructions</h2>
                <p>We would like to welcome you to Maddies Netball Club and the My Club Registration process for the 2018 year.
                    All registrations need to be completed online and fees paid at the time of registration. There have been
                    a few changes behind the scenes to the registration process made by Netball Australia and you cannot
                    use this process to register without paying at the time of registration.</p>
                <p>Please read this instruction carefully. If you have any problems, please do not hesitate to contact us by
                    <a href="mailto:maddies@maddiesnc.net">email</a>.</p>

                    so please ensure you register in the correct competition.</p>
